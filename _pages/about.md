Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) department at [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. [Feng Qian](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~fengqian/index.html). Myâ€‹ research interests include Mobile Systems, 5G Mobile Networking, and Networked VR/MR. My current research highlights challenges faced by today's 4G/5G applications and argues for a cross-layer design to overcome these challenges. I have a strong background in system/network engineering and I am skilled in C++, C, Java, and Python programming.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching sports (mostly soccer, cricket, F1, and chess) and working out.
